We added tons of <color=#FF9F80>new visuals, effects and animations</color> in all areas of the game. We've re-worked the Mobile Malware <color=#335fff>EMP Chips</color> for better balancing and further improved the <color=#ffea46>Grenade Launchers</color> and Explosion Chips.

See build notes for full details. Enjoy!
